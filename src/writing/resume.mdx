## About Me

I'm a curious software engineer with over 4 years of hands-on experience building everything from backend systems to frontend interfaces, plus DevOps and blockchain work. I've been with Huddle01 since the very beginning - started as an intern, then led the dev team for two years, and now I'm one of the founding engineers helping shape the product from the ground up. I love working with Rust, TypeScript, Node.js, React, and getting my hands dirty with DevOps. Always excited to tackle new technical challenges and build things that actually matter.
